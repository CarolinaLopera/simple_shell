.SH NAME

.B hsh
- command interpreter (simple shell).
H SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
This shell has the objective of recognizing commands and executing them from a standard input or from a path and also has two modes for its operation that are interactive and non-interactive mode


.SH INVOCATION
.B "mode interactive and non-interactive"

for the interactive mode we execute with ./hsh and it does not start with arguments and we also distinguish it perfectly since the prompete appears as follows: $ JAC.

such that the shell loops until the user interacts with the, and in non-interactive mode it is executed with the pipeline as follows: [command] | ./hsh ", it is worth clarifying that to use this mode we must start with arguments.

.SH COMMANDS EXECUTION 
In our shell, the commands that users enter are validated by passing through the respective functions as arguments. The first thing to do is check if the command contains a ./ at the beginning it would be executed as a relative path and if it begins with a "/" at the beginning this is dedicated to perform a function destined to execute paths,

For our shell to take what was entered as a command, neither of the two previous conditions must be met
